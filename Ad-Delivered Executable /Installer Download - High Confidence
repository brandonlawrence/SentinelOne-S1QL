// Ad-Delivered Executable / Installer Download – High Confidence
//
// Detects browser-initiated downloads of executable or archive files
// (.exe, .msi, .zip, .iso) delivered via online advertising infrastructure
// (gclid, adgroup_id, campaign_id).
//
// This behavior is strongly associated with malvertising-based initial
// access and frequently precedes malware execution, loader frameworks,
// or secondary payload delivery.
//
// Alert confidence increases further when correlated with execution
// shortly after download on the same endpoint.
